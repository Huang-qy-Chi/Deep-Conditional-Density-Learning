A likelihood-based deep conditional density learning method with an application to ITR. 

Please see the article "Deep Conditional Distribution Learning: Non-asymptotic Theory, Inference, and an Application to Optimal Individualized Treatment Rules." 
My work was accomplished at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I will never forget this wonderful experience at HK PolyU and am deeply grateful for it.
Happy New Year, may the lights of Victoria Harbour continue to shine brightly.

For CDL, please run main_parallel.py and main_paralleled.py for $d=5$ and $d=15$, respectively. For files Model_d5 and Model_d15, please run $\textbf{Main500.ipynb}$, 
$\textbf{Main1000.ipynb}$ and $\textbf{Main2000.ipynb}$ for ITR estimation, and run $\textbf{AHtest_size.ipynb}$, $\textbf{AHtest_power.ipynb}$ for the heterogeneity test.
